# StepwiseEQL

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs---.svg)](https://DanielVandH.github.io/StepwiseEQL.jl/)

This repository includes the code for our stepwise equation learning framework, as developed in our paper _Pushing coarse-grained models beyond the continuum limit using equation learning_ (VandenHeuvel et al., 2023).

Please see the [documentation](https://DanielVandH.github.io/StepwiseEQL.jl/) for more information, where we list information about:

1. Installing Julia and installing this package.
2. Information about the structure of the repository.
3. Scripts that reproduce the results of the paper, using [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) for producing the scripts.
