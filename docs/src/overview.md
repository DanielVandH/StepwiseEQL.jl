# Overview
In the sections that follow, we give scripts that reproduce the results in the paper. The detail behind the methods used, and the interpretation of the results, can be found in the paper. The first six sections discuss the four case studies, with the first two sections reproducing Figures 2 and 3 from the paper, and then the last sections show material that we give in the supplementary material. The complete table of contents is listed below.
