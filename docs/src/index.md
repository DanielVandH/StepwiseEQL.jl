# Introduction 

This is the documentation for StepwiseEQL.jl. [Click here to go back to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/DanielVandH/StepwiseEQL.jl).

This package contains the code for the implementation of our stepwise equation learning framework introduced 
in our paper _Pushing coarse-grained models beyond the continuum limit using equation learning_ (VandenHeuvel et al., 2023), available at 
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11086](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11086).

The implementation is specific to the models of epithelial dynamics discussed in the paper, but you could 
easily extend the code to other problems if you wish. 

The sidebar contains the following sections:
- [Installation](installation.md): How to install the package and run the code.
- [Repository Structure](repository_structure.md): A description of the structure of the GitHub repository.
- [The Algorithm](algorithm.md): A description of how to run the algorithm. This does not describe the algorithm itself - see the paper for this.
- [Paper Results](overview.md): The sections in this section reproduce all the results in the paper.
